🔍 Overview

The FTA interview process is designed to fairly and consistently assess both the technical capabilities and behavioral traits of candidates. Our goal is to hire not just technically excellent individuals, but also collaborative, thoughtful team members.

The interview consists of a single 1-hour Zoom session, divided into:

A coding exercise
3 additional technical questions focused on architecture, systems design, and implementation
Behavioral insights integrated throughout the discussion

🎯 Scoring System

Each of the 4 questions (coding + 3 technical) is scored out of 7 points:

5 points – Technical ability (problem-solving, code quality, architectural design)
2 points – Behavioral qualities (communication, resilience, collaboration)

💡 Use a clear rubric for each question to increase consistency and reduce unconscious bias.

🗣 Behavioral Evaluation

Each technical question includes a behavioral element (e.g., communication, collaboration, resilience). You can also consider a dedicated behavioral section (especially for senior roles).

Ask questions like:

“Talk me through your thinking…”
“What did you do when things didn’t work?”
“How would you approach this in a team setting?”

📋 Scoring & Debrief

After the interview:

Each interviewer completes their scorecard independently
Panel meets for structured debrief

Discrepancies are discussed and resolved
Escalate to hiring lead if needed

💡 Avoid groupthink by scoring independently first before discussion.
