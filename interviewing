h1. üîç Overview

The FTA interview process is designed to fairly and consistently assess both the technical capabilities and behavioral traits of candidates. Our goal is to hire not just technically excellent individuals, but also collaborative, thoughtful team members.

The interview consists of a *single 1-hour Zoom session*, divided into:

* A *coding exercise*
* *3 additional technical questions* focused on architecture, systems design, and implementation
* *Behavioral insights* integrated throughout the discussion

---

h2. üéØ Scoring System

Each of the 4 questions (coding + 3 technical) is scored out of *7 points*:

* *5 points* ‚Äì Technical ability (problem-solving, code quality, architectural design)
* *2 points* ‚Äì Behavioral qualities (communication, resilience, collaboration)

{panel:title=Best Practice}
Structure your scoring using a clear rubric for each question. This increases consistency and reduces unconscious bias.

h2. ü§ù Interview Panel

*Preferred panel composition:*
* 2 interviewers (1 technical lead, 1 support/observer)
* 1 optional observer/marker (ideal for scoring)

*Minimum acceptable:*
* 1 interviewer + 1 marker

Having multiple perspectives helps reduce personal bias and improves fairness in scoring.

h2. üó£ Behavioral Evaluation

Each technical question includes a behavioral element (e.g., communication, collaboration, resilience). You can also consider a dedicated behavioral section (especially for senior roles).

*Encourage interviewers to ask:*
* "Talk me through your thinking‚Ä¶"
* "What did you do when things didn‚Äôt work?"
* "How would you approach this in a team setting?"

{panel:title=Behavioral Question Guide}
Use STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) questions for consistent behavioral assessment.

h2. üìã Scoring & Debrief

After the interview:

# Each interviewer completes their scorecard independently
# Panel meets for *structured debrief*
# Discrepancies are discussed; final score is agreed upon
# If consensus can't be reached, escalate to hiring lead

{panel:title=Scoring Best Practice}
Avoid groupthink by scoring independently first before discussion.

h2. ‚úÖ Optional Enhancements

Consider implementing:

* A *candidate prep packet* outlining structure and expectations
* An *async take-home task* to assess real-world problem-solving
* *Interviewer bias training*
* *Standardized feedback process* for candidates post-interview
